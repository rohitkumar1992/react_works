              <p>At Planteshare, we have a rich stock of images and videos sourced from the crowd, as well as we have our own media stock.

They shall have access to a wide range of images and videos, and they can also top-up their media with services. Media services are additional and separate as customers can buy media files and opt for services independently.</p>
              <p>While Planetcast works independently, we have sellers and vendors on our website to enrich our platform with their contributions.</p>
