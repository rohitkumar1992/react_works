                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Planetshare is a media technology platform and an online marketplace for freelance services. We at Planetshare provide a two-way platform for people to buy and sell a host of digital services typically offered by sellers and freelance vendors. While buyers get access to a variety of post-production services and other digital services used in filmmaking or media content creation sellers and vendors get a platform to sell their content and render their services as demanded or otherwise.</p>

                        <h3>Objective</h3>
                        <p>Our objective is to offer passionate creators, sellers, and skilled service providers a platform to sell their content and render production services to our customers and clients. Also, our constant endeavor is to make content and entertainment barrier-free by enabling content creators to break the language restrictions, bandwidth limits, etc. as they opt for the services of our Service Partners (Vendors and Sellers). </p>

                        <h3>How We Work</h3>
                        <p>At Planetshare, we have a rich stock of images, graphics and videos sourced from the crowd, as well as we may have our own media stock. Sellers can come on Planetshare to sell their images, graphics and videos, and vendors can register themselves to offer their services. Also, Planetshare and its Service Partners offer its services on the chosen media files as asked by our customers and clients.</p>
                        <p>While customers have the luxury to browse and buy the images, graphics and videos of their choice, they can also opt for services on the selected media file (s). They will have access to a wide range of images, graphics and videos, and they can also top-up their chosen media file (s) with services. The media services are additional and separate as customers can buy media files and opt for services independently.</p>
                        <p>While Planetcast works independently, we have sellers and vendors on our website to enrich our platform with their contributions.</p>
