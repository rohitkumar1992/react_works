We want our users to directly rate Vendors and Sellers to let other users know about the skills and qualities of a Vendor or a Seller. We feel that by providing our users with an option to rate a Seller or a Vendor, we empower them to have their say about what they have experienced and availed. This also promotes user engagements and motivates Vendors and Sellers to take their work to the next level.</p>\n                        <ul class=\"bullet_list\">\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Please note that Levels are gained based on overall performance and not by any paid promotions or advertisements.</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>The current Levels a Seller or Vendor can achieve are, Level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and TOP RATED.</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Advancement in Levels involves no manual interventions but updated periodically by an automated system.</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Levels are neither fixed nor one directional but can move both ways (Up and Down) depending upon the ratings received from buyers.
